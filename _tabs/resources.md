This page collects a variety of references, groups, data repositories, links, and books that I find useful or motivating. In all cases, the lists are highly partial, in reflection of my own experience and limitations. If you have a suggestion for an addition, please let me know! 

## Network Science

- [Lectures on Network Systems](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu/book-lns/), a free book by [Francesco Bullo](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara covering a range of important topics related to dynamial systems on networks. The development of the linear algebra toolbox for approaching network problems is clear and of high general utility.   
- [Aaron Clauset](https://aaronclauset.github.io/) at CU Boulder maintains excellent lecture notes on [Network Analysis and Modeling](https://aaronclauset.github.io/courses/5352/) and [Biological Networks](https://aaronclauset.github.io/courses/3352/). 
- *"The society of [Women in Network Science](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/wins) (WiNS) connects **women, trans and non-binary gender** network scientists from different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nations. The society aims to recognize the work, perspectives and expertise of its members to create bridges between academia, government, and private industry related to network science."* 

## Data Sets

- Tidy Tuesday is an initiative organized by the R For Data Science online learning community. Each week, they pose a different data analysis problem in which people can practice their programming and data science skills. The collection of [data sets](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is particularly nice. 
- [Austin Benson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/) at Cornell hosts [a collection of data sets](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/) for a range of problems related to graphs and hypergraphs. 

## Python Programming

- [Lecture notes and videos](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/schedule/) from PIC16A, my course on core skills in Python programming and data science. 
- [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) by Jake VanderPlas is an excellent, rapid overview of fundamental Python skills. It is suitable for those who have experience in several other programming languages, or for those who previously learned Python and just need a brush-up.  
- [Lecture notes](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16B/schedule/) from PIC16B, my course on advanced computational and data science in Python.  
- [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas is an excellent and freely-available online resource for practical data science in Python. 

## Math, Data Science, and Social Justice

- I am a Partner at [QSIDE](https://qsideinstitute.org/), the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity. QSIDE has a number of ongoing projects and welcomes collaborators. 
- The 2021 [MSRI Workshop on Mathematics and Racial Justice](https://www.msri.org/workshops/1012) collected a [list of resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-40eCiJdlOIxDWnALv-kqO5-0c5NH1M857-_kTj-GeE/edit?usp=sharing) on mathematics and racial justice, including books, journal articles, organizations, and data sets.
- The [Just Mathematics Collective](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/) is an international collective of mathematicians whose goal is to "to shift the global mathematics community towards justice, via genuine anti-racism, anti-militarism, and solidarity with the Global South."
- [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://bookshop.org/books/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy/9780553418835) by Cathy O'Neil
- [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://bookshop.org/books/algorithms-of-oppression-how-search-engines-reinforce-racism/9781479837243) by Safiya Umoja Noble
- [Automating Inequality](https://bookshop.org/books/automating-inequality-how-high-tech-tools-profile-police-and-punish-the-poor/9781250215789) by Virginia Eubanks

## Social Justice, Broadly

- [Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women](https://bookshop.org/books/entitled-how-male-privilege-hurts-women/9781984826558) by Kate Manne. 
- [How to be an Antiracist](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-be-an-antiracist/9780525509288) by Ibram X. Kendi. 
- [An Indigenous People's History of the United States](https://bookshop.org/books/an-indigenous-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/9780807057834) by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz.
