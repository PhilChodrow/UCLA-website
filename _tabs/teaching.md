My goal as an educator is to make mathematical reasoning and quantitative problem-solving accessible to **all** students. I approach this goal through actively inclusive teaching practices and evidence-based evaluation of their effectiveness. Techniques I use include flipped classrooms, project-based learning, structured group work, writing assignments, and specifications-based grading. 

My students have said some [nice things](/feedback) about my teaching.
