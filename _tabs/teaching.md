My goal as an educator is to make mathematical reasoning and quantitative problem-solving accessible to **all** students. I consistently gather data about my teaching, and use it to assess the accessibility and relevance of my offerings. I am especially interested in inclusive teaching practices for ameliorating race and gender disparities in applied mathematics and data science. 

My students have said some [nice things](/feedback) about my classes. 

## Current and Recent Courses
