My research focuses on the development of mathematical tools for studying complex social and biological systems. Much of my recent work is in the broad area of *network science,* the study of data and dynamics on graph-like structures. Things I'm currently thinking about include spectra of operators on hypergraphs, statistical models of animal dominance hierarchies, and models of nonlinear opinion dynamics.
