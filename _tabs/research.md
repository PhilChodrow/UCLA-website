# Research

My research addresses several topics in the mathematical study of complex systems. My primary interests include theory and applications of random graphs, dynamical models of social structures, and data science applications supporting equity and sustainability.

## Random Graphs, Algorithms, and Computation

Random graphs are probability distributions over sets of graphs. They are the foundation of the statistical study of network data, and also possess interesting mathematical properties. I study questions like: 

- How can random graph models illuminate fundamental limitations on graph data science tasks?
- Can we approximate important summary statistics from random graph models without sampling from them? 
- How can we use random graph models to develop new graph algorithms?
- How can we extend common random graph models for studying complex data with multiway ("higher order") interactions? 

Addressing these questions often requires tools from probability, optimization, combinatorics, and random matrix theory.

## Dynamics of Biosocial Systems

Human and animal societies are structured by persistent hierarchies, inequalities, and divisions. Dynamical models can help us understand when these phenomena emerge and how they persist. 

- **Hierarchies**: how do hierarchies of dominance, prestige, or influence sustain themselves over time? In recent work (Kawakatsu et al. 2021), collaborators and I proposed a feedback mechanism between individual decision-making and social ranks. This mechanism leads to sharp transitions between egalitarian and hierarchical societies. Currently, I am collaborating on a project using multilayer network models to understand how animal societies express dominance hierarchies through different forms of interactions. 
- **Echo chambers**: how do agents in conversation form echo chambers? Under what circumstances are echo chambers self-perpetuating, and what can be done? Models of *opinion dynamics* allow us to study these questions using dynamical systems theory. While models models of opinion dynamics have agents update their opinions in response to those of their peers, I am especially interested in models which also agential decision-making about who to talk to and who to trust.

## Data Science Applications

I seek opportunities to contribute mathematical methods to the study of real-world data sets, especially in the service of equity and sustainability. My contributions here include information-geometric methods for studying spatial segregation and multilayer network methods for transportation planning. At the moment, I am supervising student-led projects analyzing gender representation in mathematical subdisciplines and racial disparities in criminal sentencing.
