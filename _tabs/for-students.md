# FAQs for Students

## Basics

#### Who are you? 

I'm Phil Chodrow, a visiting assistant professor in the Math Department at UCLA. I grew up in Virginia, did undergrad at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, and did my PhD (after a few years traveling and working) at MIT. Then I came here to UCLA! 

I love applied math, data science, Star Trek,  penguins, cooking, tea, studio Ghibli movies, traditional martial arts, and effective pedagogy. 

#### How should I address you? 

If you're not sure, please call me "Professor Chodrow." I usually invite students in PIC16B, Learning Assistants who work with my students, and student research collaborators to address me as "Phil." 

Please remember to address all your professors respectfully and according to their preferences. When in doubt, "Professor X" or "Dr. X" is always appropriate. Before addressing a professor by their first name, ask yourself whether they have explicitly invited you to do so. Ask yourself twice if addressing a female, LGBTQ+, or BIPOC professor -- routine disregard of titles and credentials is one of many ways in which academic culture replicates harm against these scholars.

## My Profession

#### What does a mathematician do?

[This graphic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtzOT2MWYAA78IO?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) by Marissa Kawehi Loving gives a great high-level overview of the activities that go into a career as an academic mathematician. My activities look relatively similar. Mentally, I'd divide them into the following broad categories: 

- "**Doing math**": developing models and proving results; performing computation and data analysis, reading papers. 
- **Writing**: creating mathematical notes; writing scholarly papers; writing reviews of the scholarly work of others.
- **Communication**: largely emails and meetings. Lots of the "doing math" part happens in these meetings (i.e. collaboratively). 
    - An important category here is **mentorship**: working with junior collaborators and students; talking about ideas; giving feedback. 
    - Another important category here is **speaking** about my research, which used to happen at conferences but is now largely online. 
- **Teaching**: I spend a **lot** of time on teaching. The preparation includes formulating course philosophies, designing curricula, writing lectures and assignments, etc. Then there's the best part -- working with students -- as well as managing instructional teams, handling grades, and troubleshooting concerns as they arise.  
- **Professional development**: there's a lot of room for me to grow. One of my main goals is to further develop my courses as actively anti-sexist and anti-racist, and measure their effectiveness along these axes. I attend trainings, read, and learn from others. 

#### Is it nice to be an academic mathematician?

Here's my personal list of the pros and cons about being an academic mathematician. This list is quite personal to me, and reflects my identity and priorities. Note that the pros and cons for mathematicians working in industry might look considerably different. 

Pros:
- Freedom to control my own schedule. 
- Freedom to set my priorities and spend much of my time thinking about things that interest me. 
- Freedom to decide whom to work with (very important to me).

Cons:
- Low salary compared to many other careers for quantitative people (although still enough for me to have a basically comfortable life). 
- Uncertainty about long-term job prospects (permanent jobs are extremely difficult to obtain). 
- Lack of control over *where* I will ultimately live, due to the point above. 

#### Is academic mathematics an equitable space, a "meritocracy," or a "neutral" discipline?

No. Academic mathematics is not yet an equitable community, and many parts of it replicate systemic misogyny, racism, ableism, and classism. Certain people, departments, and institutions are not safe or nurturing spaces for members of certain groups. A [recent article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/modern-mathematics-confronts-its-white-patriarchal-past/) in *Scientific American* highlighted the intersection of racism and misogyny in modern mathematics. 

Due in part to my own privileged identity, I have had an overall pleasant experience in mathematics which makes me want to stay here. If you do aspire to become an academic mathematician, and especially if you benefit from intersecting privilege, then part of your responsibility is to reflect on what work you will do to make our profession a more equitable and just place. The [Mission](/mission) page expresses how I think about this responsibility, and the [Resources](/resources) page contains some links that might help you get started. 



## Classes

#### What are you teaching?
In academic year '21-'22, I am teaching: 

- [PIC16A](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A//), Fall '21
- [PIC16B](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16B//), Fall '21 and Winter '22
- MATH 168, Spring '22 

#### Can I have a PTE override into your course? 
Unfortunately, PTEs are not used in PIC courses, so I can't give you an override. My suggestion is to monitor the waitlist during the first two weeks of class, as spots tend to open up. All students on the waitlist in the first two weeks will be automatically enrolled. 

Additionally, please note that, in academic year '21-22, **all** offerings of PIC16A by professors Perlmutter and Murray will be taught on the flipped class model that I developed last year. So, if you've heard good things about that class, please know that you'll be able to have that experience with several of the PIC16A instructors.  

#### How long will you be at UCLA?
I am a visiting scholar, with a contract running through Spring 2023. While there is a possibility that I will stay slightly longer than that, this isn't likely. I will not be a member of the UCLA faculty long-term. 

#### Where will you go? 

Long-term, I hope to join the faculty of a primarily-undergraduate research institution, such as a liberal arts college. 

## Research

#### Can I do research with you?
I'd be delighted to chat with you to learn more about what you're interested in and what opportunities may exist for you to pursue those interests. That said, my ability to directly take on research students is  *very limited.* This reflects my status as a visiting scholar without my own funding. Depending on your interests, there *may* be possibilities. Please don't hesitate to ask. Because I am not usually able to offer funding to support student research, the easiest way to work with me is to enroll in a contract course (MATH 197) during the school year. 

Generally speaking, to perform theoretical research with me, you should have background from either MATH 168 (network science) or MATH 156 (machine learning). However, I evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. I also sometimes accept students for data science projects. Usually, the student must propose the project to me, although I sometimes have project prompts I can offer. It is usually necessary for data science students to have programming skills at the level of PIC16B or equivalent. Background in mathematics or statistics is also desirable. 

## Advice and Recommendation Letters 

#### Can I talk to you about classes/grad school/jobs/internships? 
Definitely! Shoot me an email and we'll set up a meeting. Just to set expectations, I know a lot more about academic careers than I do about jobs and internships. 

#### Will you write me a letter of recommendation for grad school/jobs/internships?

If you have completed a course with me or are currently enrolled, you are welcome to request a letter from me. I will only refuse if you are requesting support for an application for jobs or internships involving surveillance, policing, or military applications. If I feel that I am not able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you -- but if you still want a letter from me, I will still write it.

Please keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or office hours. If you’d like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.

To request a letter, send me an email! Your email should clearly indicate when you need the letter, what it is for, why the opportunity interests you, and why I am the right person to write in support of your application. Please include clear instructions for submitting the letter once it’s written. If you will need me to submit my letter to multiple programs, please let me know roughly how many you expect to need. If possible, please include some sort of resume/CV — it doesn’t have to be official — detailing your past experiences relevant to the application. Please give me at least one month of advance notice when possible.

#### I want to learn more about the intersection of math, data science, and social justice. Where do I start? 
That's a great question, Imaginary Student! Click over to the [Resources](/resources) page on the left for some of my favorite organizations and books related to this topic. 

## Thoughts on Software 

#### What software do you use? 
I spend a lot of time on my laptop, and I've given some thought to the tools that allow me to make that time most productive. Here's what I'm using these days: 

- **Programming languages**: [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). I also know (and teach) [Python](https://www.python.org/), but Julia has largely replaced Python in my research workflows. I use R when I am primarily working with data frames or when I need to construct scientific graphics, and I use Julia for most other tasks. 
- **Text editor**: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use this for writing code, as well as writing mathematical documents and research papers using LaTeX. When coding in R, I often use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) instead of VSCode. 
- **Operating system**: MacOS. I don't have strong negative feelings about Windows, but as someone who writes code I strongly prefer an OS with a first class terminal. I have dabbled in Linux but don't consider myself enough of a power user to justify the time investment. Because I have access to high-performance servers, I don't need a very powerful laptop -- I just use an entry-level MacBook Air. 
- **Website**: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). This website, as well as my course websites, are generated by Jekyll using plaintext files. I edit these files in VSCode, run Jekyll to preview them, and then push them to GitHub where they are processed and hosted online. You can learn more about this process [here](https://www.jekyllnow.com/), or by taking PIC16B with me. Through working with websites like these, I have picked up a **minimal** amount of HTML and CSS. 
    - Ethics note: GitHub has [contributed an infrastructure product to ICE](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/ice-contract-github-sparks-developer-protests/604339/) and developed a machine learning product that [may infringe on open source code licenses](https://sdtimes.com/os/github-copilot-sparks-debates-around-open-source-licenses/). While I rely on GitHub for now, I may change to a competitor like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) in the future. 
- **Email client**: [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) -- it's free, simple, and cross-platform. 
- **Launcher**: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). Pressing a simple keyboard shortcut spawns a search bar when I can open apps, search for files, etc. 
- **Browser**: [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com). A customizable browser compatible with Chrome plugins. 


#### Is programming language A better than programming language B?
Probably not! Most programming languages have certain strengths in which they excel. You don't need "the best" programming language -- you need the one that's right for your task. For example, R and Python have different strengths for data science, and most practicing data scientists know both. Here are my thoughts on the languages I know and use. 
- **Python**: extremely versatile, pretty good at almost everything. Often slower than compiled languages like C++ or just-in-time compiled languages like Julia. Widely used in industry, and an excellent first language to learn. Extremely vibrant ecosystem of free software modules. 
- **R**: specialized for data analysis and statistics. World-class handling of tabular data via the Tidyverse ecosystem. `ggplot2` is the world's best two-dimensional data visualization system, bar none. The RStudio IDE is fantastic, and better than any other free IDE I've seen for any other language.  
- **Julia**: specialized for technical computing (science and engineering applications). Similar syntax to Python. Often compared to Matlab in its focus, but open-source and (in my view) easier to understand. Well-written Julia is extremely fast, and can reach speeds comparable to C++. 

## Other

#### Can I ask you to speak at my student organization? 

Yes! I love doing this kind of thing. Send me a note. 

#### Can I talk to you for a class project?

On occasion, students approach me with a class project that asks them to interview a scientist, faculty member, or professional. If hearing from someone like me meets the professional goals of your project, then feel free to ask me about this. 

#### Are you a data scientist?

In some ways, yes. I'm a mathematician and computational scientist motivated by problems involving data. My training in graduate school included coursework in statistics, optimization, and machine learning. In many of my research projects, I either develop algorithms or directly analyze data sets. Additionally, I teach data science in Python at UCLA, and supervise student data science projects. Before I went to graduate school, I worked as a data analyst at [Health Leads](https://healthleadsusa.org/), a nonprofit organization focused on integrating social services with healthcare. 

That said, "data scientist" isn't my main professional identity, and I'm not knowledgeable about the life of a data scientist at, say, a tech company or a startup. My knowledge of how to get these jobs, and what to do once you have one, is pretty limited. 

#### What kinds of books do you like to read? 

Some of the kinds of books I like are scifi and fantasy novels; U.S. and modern world history; feminism and antiracism; and yes, the occasional math book. 

Feel free to suggest something to me!

Perhaps like you, the growing presence of screens in my life has detracted from my reading. I'm trying to fix that! To keep myself on track, I'm keeping a [list](/reading) of the things I've been reading lately.

(In case you're wondering, I do read a lot of math, but most of it is in scholarly articles rather than books.)
