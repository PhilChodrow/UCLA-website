Welcome! Here's a few FAQs. 

## Basics

**Uh, who are you?**<br>
I'm Phil Chodrow, a visiting assistant professor in the Math Department at UCLA. I grew up in Virginia, did undergrad at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, and did my PhD (after a few year's break) at MIT. Then I came here! 

I love applied math, data science, Star Trek, penguins, tea, traditional martial arts, and effective pedagogy. 

**How should I address you?** <br>
If you're not sure, please call me "Professor Chodrow." I usually invite students in my advanced classes, LAs who work with my classes, and students who research with me to address me as "Phil." 

Please remember to address all your professors respectfully and according to their preferences. When in doubt, "Professor X" or "Dr. X" is always appropriate. Before addressing a professor by their first name, ask yourself whether they have explicitly invited you to do so. Ask yourself twice if addressing a female, LGBTQ+, or BIPOC professor -- routine disregard of titles and credentials is one of many ways in which academic culture replicates harm against these scholars.

## Classes

**What are you teaching next year?** <br>
Next year ('21-'22), I am scheduled to teach: 

- [PIC16A](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A//), Fall '21
- [PIC16B](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16B//), Fall '21 and Winter '22
- MATH 168, Spring '22

**Can I have a PTE override into your course?** <br>
Unfortunately, PTEs are not used in PIC courses, so I can't give you an override. My suggestion is to monitor the waitlist during the first two weeks of class, as spots tend to open up. All students on the waitlist in the first two weeks will be automatically enrolled. 

Additionally, please note that, in academic year '21-22, **all** offerings of PIC16A will be taught on the flipped class model that I developed last year. So, if you've heard good things about that class, please know that you'll be able to have that experience with any of the PIC16A instructors. 


## Research

**Can I do research with you?** <br>
I'd be delighted to chat with you to learn more about what you're interested in and what opportunities may exist for you to pursue those interests. That said, my ability to directly take on research students is  *very limited*. This reflects my status as a visiting scholar without my own funding. However, there *may* be possibilities. Please don't hesitate to ask. Because I am not usually able to offer funding to support student research, the easiest way to work with me is to enroll in a contract course (MATH 197) during the school year. 

Generally speaking, to perform perform theoretical research with me, you should have background from either MATH 168 (network science) or MATH 156 (machine learning). However, I evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. I also sometimes accept students for data science projects. Usually, the student must propose the project to me, although I sometimes have project prompts I can offer. It is usually necessary for data science students to have programming skills at the level of PIC16B or equivalent. Background in mathematics or statistics is also desirable. 

## Advice and Recommendation Letters 

**Can I talk to you about classes/grad school/jobs/internships?** <br>
Definitely! Shoot me an email and we'll set up a meeting. 

**Will you write me a letter of recommendation for grad school/jobs/internships?** <br>
If you have completed a course with me or are currently enrolled, you are welcome to request a letter from me. I will only refuse if you are requesting support for an application for jobs or internships involving surveillance, policing, or military applications. If I feel that I am not able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you -- but if you still want a letter from me, I will still write it.

Please keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or office hours. If you’d like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.

To request a letter, send me an email! Your email should clearly indicate when you need the letter, what it is for, why the opportunity interests you, and why I am the right person to write in support of your application. Please include clear instructions for submitting the letter once it’s written. If you will need me to submit my letter to multiple programs, please let me know roughly how many you expect to need. If possible, please include some sort of resume/CV — it doesn’t have to be official — detailing your past experiences relevant to the application. Please give me at least one month of advance notice when possible.

**I want to learn more about the intersection of math, data science, and social justice. Where do I start?**  <br>

## Other

**Can I ask you to speak at my student organization?** <br>
Yes! I love doing this kind of thing. Send me a note.
