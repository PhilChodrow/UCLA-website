Mathematical science is a human endeavor. It is performed by humans, and has consequences for other humans. Historically and into the present, practitioners of mathematical science are disproportionately White and male. Historically and into the present, practitioners of mathematical science have created tools used to control marginalized populations, concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and enhance the violent power of military and police forces. 

I aspire to a more just, peaceful, and equitable role for mathematical science.  Toward this vision, I offer the following acknowledgments and commitments. 

- **Several of my identities are over-represented and normalized in mathematics and the academy.** <br>
I am a White, heterosexual, cisgender man, and a 2nd generation academic. I promote a more diverse mathematical community by amplifying the voices of minoritized scholars, decentering myself in conversations that aren't about me, and examining how my intersecting privileges can be tools for equitable progress rather than self-advancement at the expense of others. I am aware that my work as an aspiring ally is never "done," and that I will need to perpetually reexamine my own positionality and my understanding of my other commitments towards justice. 
- **Many female, nonbinary, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC students face discouragement and trauma in their STEM learning journey.** <br>
I envision a world in which all identities experience encouragement, safety, and grace in their pursuit of STEM education. I design inclusive classrooms with vibrant learning communities, clear expectations, and intentional assessment strategies. I conduct regular evaluations and *listen to my students* in order to understand how to make my teaching more responsive to the needs of all the learners who enter my classroom. 
- **Many practitioners of mathematical science create tools for surveillance, control, advertising, physical violence, financial manipulation, and misinformation spread.** <br>
While the choices of individuals to pursue such work is understandable in our current system of incentives, the net result is that much of our collective technical expertise actively works against our collective well-being. I work towards an ethical practice of mathematics and computation by actively incorporating ethics into my classrooms. These include case studies in algorithmic harm, as well as extended projects which model the role of mathematics and computation in addressing climate change, cultural representation, and systemic bias. 

## Projects on Data Science and Social Justice

I am pursuing several projects at the intersection of data science, equity, and social justice. These are in-progress: look for more here soon! 

- Measuring gender representation in mathematical subfields with Ben Brill (undergraduate mentee), Heather Zinn Brooks, and Mason Porter. 
- Disparities in state criminal sentencing with Hinal Jajal (undergraduate mentee).
