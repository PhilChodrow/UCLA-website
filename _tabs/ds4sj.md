I am pursuing several projects at the intersection of data science, equity, and social justice. These are in-progress: look for more here soon! 

- Measuring gender representation in mathematical subfields with Ben Brill (undergraduate mentee), Heather Zinn Brooks, and Mason Porter. 
- Disparities in state criminal sentencing with Hinal Jajal (undergraduate mentee), Chad Higdon-Topaz, and Judge Higdon-Topaz.
