# About

I am a Hedrick Visiting Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA, where I am mentored by Mason Porter. My interests include network science, nonlinear dynamics, applied probability, and machine learning. In [my research](/research), I build principled tools for studying the structure and dynamics of complex, networked systems. Recently, I've been thinking about spectral properties of hypergraphs, dominance hierarchies in biosocial systems, and nonlinear opinion dynamics on graphs. 

I am also a passionate educator, enthusiastic about evidence-based pedagogy, student-centered design, and inclusion in the classroom. I [teach subjects](/teaching) including data science, mathematical network science, applied probability, and computing.  I am a member of the Gold '21 Cohort of [MAA Project NeXT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next), a professional development program for teacher-scholars in mathematics. 

I believe deeply in the role of data science in promoting equity and social justice.  I am currently working with undergraduate collaborators on projects related to gender representation in mathematical subfields and racial disparities in criminal sentencing. I am a Partner at [QSIDE](https://qsideinstitute.org/), the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity. 

I did my PhD at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://www.mit.edu/~orc/) under the mentorship of [Marta González](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez) and [Patrick Jaillet](http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/). My research at MIT was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Prior to MIT, I was an undergraduate at Swarthmore College and a Fulbright Research Scholar at the University of Oslo, Norway.

- **August 25th, 2021**: "Space-based observational constraints on NO2 air pollution inequality from diesel traffic in major US cities" is now published in *Geophysics Research Letters*! This collaboration, led by [Angelique Demetillo](https://maryangelique.com) (Environmental Science and Atmospheric Chemistry, UVA) and [Sally Pusede](https://pusede.evsc.virginia.edu) (Environmental Science, UVA), uses satellite data and spatial analysis to study class, ethnic, and racial disparities in NO₂ pollution in major US cities. We used the information-geometric tools from "Structure and information in spatial segregation" to study ethnic and racial segregation.
