# About

I am a Hedrick Visiting Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA, where I am mentored by Mason Porter. My interests include network science, nonlinear dynamics, applied probability, and machine learning. In [my research](/research), I build principled tools for studying the structure and dynamics of complex, networked systems. Recently, I've been thinking about spectral properties of hypergraphs, dominance hierarchies in biosocial systems, and nonlinear opinion dynamics on graphs. 

I am a passionate educator, and [teach subjects](/teaching) ranging from applied probability to network science to technical computing. I am enthusiastic about  evidence-based pedagogy, project-oriented course formats, and inclusion in the classroom. I am a member of the Gold '21 Cohort of [MAA Project NeXT](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next). I am also a Partner of [QSIDE](https://qsideinstitute.org/), the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity. 

I did my PhD at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://www.mit.edu/~orc/) under the mentorship of [Marta Gonz√°lez](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez) and [Patrick Jaillet](http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/). My research at MIT was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
